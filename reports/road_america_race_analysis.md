## 📈 RECOMMENDATIONS

### FOR TEAM STRATEGY

1. **Focus on race consistency** over single-lap pace (evidenced by Car #42 vs Car #18)
2. **Mid-to-late race performance** critical - multiple cars set best laps on laps 10-12
3. **Midfield battles** represent biggest opportunity for position gains given tight time spreads
4. **Track position management** essential given Road America's 14-turn layout and limited overtaking zones

### FOR DRIVER DEVELOPMENT

1. **Study Car #18's race management** - perfect balance of pace and consistency
2. **Analyze Car #42's data** to understand qualifying vs race performance delta
3. **Target 2:12.00-2:15.00 lap times** for competitive midfield performance
4. **Focus on sector consistency** across Road America's 14 turns

### FOR TRACK-SPECIFIC OPTIMIZATION

1. **Master the high-speed sections** - Road America's 4.048-mile layout rewards top-end speed
2. **Optimize corner exits** - critical for overtaking opportunities on long straights
3. **Tire management** - late-race pace suggests successful tire strategy execution
