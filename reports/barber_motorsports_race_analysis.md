## 📈 RECOMMENDATIONS

### FOR TEAM STRATEGY

1. **Focus on race consistency** over single-lap pace (evidenced by Car #2 vs Car #13)
2. **Mid-to-late race performance** critical - multiple cars set best laps on laps 13-16
3. **Midfield battles** represent biggest opportunity for position gains given tight time spreads
4. **Track position management** essential given Barber Motorsports Park's 17-turn layout and limited overtaking zones on this technical circuit

### FOR DRIVER DEVELOPMENT

1. **Study Car #13's race management** - perfect balance of pace and consistency
2. **Analyze Car #2's data** to understand qualifying vs race performance delta
3. **Target 1:35.00-1:37.00 lap times** for competitive midfield performance
4. **Focus on sector consistency** across Barber Motorsports Park's 17 turns - the flowing nature rewards smooth driving

### FOR TRACK-SPECIFIC OPTIMIZATION

1. **Master the technical sections** - Barber Motorsports Park's 2.38-mile layout with 17 turns rewards precision and smooth inputs
2. **Optimize corner exits** - critical for carrying speed through the flowing sections
3. **Tire management** - late-race pace suggests successful tire strategy execution
4. **Minimize mistakes** - the technical nature means errors cost more time here than on faster tracks
