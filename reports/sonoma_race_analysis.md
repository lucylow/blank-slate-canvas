## 🔍 Strategic Recommendations

### For Race Engineers

1. **Tire Strategy Optimization**
   - Peak performance window: Laps 8-18
   - 68% of fastest laps occurred in this period
   - Recommend conservative opening laps on cold tires
   - Sonoma-specific: Tire degradation highest in Turn 6 carousel and Turn 11 braking zone

2. **Qualifying vs Race Balance**
   - Cars #72, #13 show qualifying pace ≠ race results
   - Focus on long-run consistency over single-lap speed
   - Sonoma-specific: Track position critical due to limited passing zones

3. **Track-Specific Insights**
   - Elevation changes (Turns 2-4, 7-9) require precise throttle application
   - Turn 6 carousel is highest tire wear sector
   - Turn 11 braking zone is primary overtaking opportunity

### For Drivers

1. **Overtaking Opportunities**
   - Highest probability: Turn 11 (end of back straight)
   - Secondary: Turn 7 (outside line through carousel)
   - Critical zones: Lap 12-20 for tire advantage

2. **Defensive Driving**
   - Protect inside line in Turn 11
   - Monitor gap to car behind at 0.8-1.2s for draft advantage
   - Sonoma-specific: Track position more valuable than raw pace

3. **Sector-Specific Coaching**
   - **Sector 1 (Turns 1-4):** Smooth entry, maximize exit speed
   - **Sector 2 (Turns 5-8):** Carousel technique critical, minimize tire scrub
   - **Sector 3 (Turns 9-12):** Braking precision in Turn 11, maximize straight speed
