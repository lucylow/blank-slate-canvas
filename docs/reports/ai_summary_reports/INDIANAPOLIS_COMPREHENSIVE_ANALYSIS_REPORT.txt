4. **LIMITED TELEMETRY SAMPLE**:
   Issue: Only analyzed 500k of millions of points
   Impact: May miss rare events or patterns
   Recommendation: Implement distributed processing for full dataset

5. **RACE 1 vs RACE 2 DISCREPANCY**:
   Issue: 13.6s difference in mean lap times
   Impact: Unclear if due to conditions or data quality
   Recommendation: Add weather and track condition metadata

================================================================================
SECTION 12: STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

🏁 FOR RACE ENGINEERS:

1. **TIRE STRATEGY**:
   - Monitor lateral G-forces (>2.0g indicates aggressive driving)
   - Plan pit stops when lap times degrade >3 seconds
   - Indianapolis causes higher rear tire wear (high-speed corners)

2. **BRAKE MANAGEMENT**:
   - Peak pressures of 131 bar are sustainable
   - Monitor brake temperature in Turn 1 (3.045g braking)
   - Adjust brake bias if rear pressure exceeds front

3. **SETUP OPTIMIZATION**:
   - Focus on straight-line speed (221 mph top speed critical)
   - Maximize high-speed corner stability (2.4g lateral)
   - Gear ratios should prioritize 4th/5th gear performance

🏎️  FOR DRIVERS:

1. **CONSISTENCY OVER SPEED**:
   - Westin Workman won championship with consistency
   - Smooth inputs preserve tires and reduce lap time variance
   - Aim for σ < 20s in lap time standard deviation

2. **BRAKING TECHNIQUE**:
   - Threshold braking at 2.5-3.0g is optimal for Indianapolis
   - Avoid over-braking (>3.2g causes lock-ups)
   - Trail braking into Turn 1 improves rotation

3. **THROTTLE MANAGEMENT**:
   - Mean throttle of 61.8% indicates power track
   - Focus on early throttle application out of slow corners
   - Use full throttle (100%) on main straight for maximum speed

📊 FOR DATA ANALYSTS:

1. **IMPLEMENT DATA CLEANING PIPELINE**:
   - Remove near-zero lap times (<30 seconds)
   - Flag outliers beyond 3 standard deviations
   - Validate telemetry timestamps for consistency

2. **ENHANCE ANALYSIS CAPABILITIES**:
   - Add sector timing analysis (3 sectors recommended)
   - Implement lap-by-lap comparison tools
   - Create driver performance scorecards

3. **PREDICTIVE MODELING**:
   - Use telemetry to predict tire wear
   - Forecast lap time degradation
   - Identify optimal pit stop windows

   - Significantly faster than Sonoma (221 vs 190 mph)
   - Harder braking zones (3.045g vs 1.754g)
   - More full-throttle sections (61.8% vs 31.4%)

🎯 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HACKATHON:

1. **FOCUS ON REAL-TIME VISUALIZATION**:
   - Build interactive dashboard showing live telemetry
   - Display G-force heatmaps, speed traces, brake pressure
   - GPS-based racing line visualization
   - Alert system for anomalies

2. **IMPLEMENT AI-POWERED INSIGHTS**:
   - Tire wear prediction model (high impact)
   - Lap time forecasting
   - Strategy optimization (pit stop timing)
   - Overtaking probability calculator

3. **SHOWCASE TRD DATASET EFFECTIVELY**:
   - Highlight 12-channel telemetry richness
   - Demonstrate cross-race analysis capabilities
   - Prove value for race engineers and drivers
   - Show championship-level insights

4. **ADDRESS DATA QUALITY**:
   - Implement robust data cleaning pipeline
   - Handle missing values and outliers gracefully
   - Validate results against known racing benchmarks
   - Cross-reference with official race results
