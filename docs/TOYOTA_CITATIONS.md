## QUICK COPY-PASTE BLOCKS

### For "Why Toyota/GR Cup?" Section

```
Toyota Gazoo Racing North America operates the GR Cup, a spec-series 
championship featuring 31 Toyota GR86 vehicles competing across 7 race 
weekends annually. The 2025 season crowned Westin Workman as champion, 
confirming the series' active competitive status [1]. TGRNA's strategic 
priorities include driver development (TGR-DC program [3]), digital 
engagement (esports launched 2025 [2]), and data-driven R&D aligned with 
Toyota's $13.9B battery investment [6].
```

### For Technical Appendix

```
GR Cup telemetry data is available through the Hack-the-Track hackathon 
resources [9], providing 6 tracks × 28 drivers = 168 race records. Known 
data issues (lap=32768 errors, timestamp misalignment) are documented and 
handled by our ETL pipeline, demonstrating domain expertise and production-ready 
code quality.
```

### For Impact Section

```
PitWall A.I. addresses 434 annual pit decisions (7 weekends × 2 races × 31 cars) 
with an average time savings of 0.94 seconds per optimal call, translating to 
1-2 positions gained per race. This directly supports TGRNA's customer racing 
philosophy of enabling amateur drivers with day jobs to compete effectively [7].
