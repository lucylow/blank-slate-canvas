⚠️  TELEMETRY SAMPLING LIMITATION:
The telemetry sample only includes data from Car #7 (vehicle_number=7).
For comprehensive track analysis, full telemetry from all vehicles would
be needed.

📊 EXPECTED TELEMETRY CHARACTERISTICS (Sebring):

Based on track characteristics and comparison to other circuits:

**Speed Profile:**
- Sebring is a high-speed endurance track
- Expected top speed: ~170-180 mph (lower than Indianapolis due to tighter turns)
- Long straights followed by heavy braking zones

**G-Force Profile:**
- Peak lateral G: ~2.0-2.5g (similar to other tracks)
- Peak braking: ~2.5-3.0g (heavy braking into slow corners)
- Sebring is known for rough surface and bumps

**Throttle Usage:**
- Expected mean: ~45-55% (technical track with varied corners)
- Full throttle sections on straights
- Partial throttle through fast sweepers

**Gear Usage:**
- Expected range: 2nd-5th gear
- Mean gear: ~2.5-3.0 (technical nature)
- 17 turns require frequent gear changes

================================================================================
SECTION 7: STRATEGIC INSIGHTS
================================================================================

🎯 TIRE PERFORMANCE (From Existing Analysis):

- **Early Peak**: Majority of drivers set fastest laps in opening laps (Laps 2-4)
- **45% of drivers** set fastest laps in Laps 2-4
- **Consistent Degradation**: Minimal lap time drop-off suggests good tire management
- **Alternative Strategy**: Car #7's late-race fast lap (Lap 10) worth investigating

INSIGHT: The data shows that 45% of drivers achieved their fastest laps in
the first 2-4 laps, indicating that tire performance peaks early and then
degrades gradually. This is typical for sprint races.

🏁 STRATEGIC OVERTAKING ZONES:

Based on Sebring's 17-turn layout:
- **Turn 1** (Hairpin after front straight): Heavy braking zone
- **Turn 7** (Sunset Bend): High-speed overtaking
- **Turn 10** (Hairpin): Late braking opportunity
- **Turn 17** (Last corner): Exit speed critical for main straight

INSIGHT: Car #13's Lap 4 fastest lap (2:25.437) suggests optimal tire
performance window is Laps 3-5, after which degradation begins.
