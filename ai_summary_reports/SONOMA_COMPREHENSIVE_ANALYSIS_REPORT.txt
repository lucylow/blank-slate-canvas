================================================================================
SECTION 3: TELEMETRY DEEP DIVE
================================================================================

📡 TELEMETRY CHANNELS AVAILABLE

The TRD telemetry system captures 9 distinct channels at high frequency:

1. Steering_Angle: 67,564 samples (steering wheel position)
2. accx_can: 67,564 samples (longitudinal acceleration/G-force)
3. accy_can: 67,564 samples (lateral acceleration/G-force)
4. ath: 67,564 samples (throttle position %)
5. gear: 67,564 samples (current gear)
6. nmot: 13,526 samples (engine RPM)
7. pbrake_f: 67,564 samples (front brake pressure)
8. pbrake_r: 67,564 samples (rear brake pressure)
9. speed: 13,526 samples (vehicle speed in mph)

📊 DETAILED TELEMETRY ANALYSIS (Race 1 Sample - 500,000 data points)

🎯 STEERING ANALYSIS:
--------------------
Mean Angle: -8.034° (slight left bias)
Standard Deviation: 40.987°
Maximum Left: -312.400° (tight hairpin)
Maximum Right: +160.800°
Range: 473.200°

INSIGHT: The negative mean suggests Sonoma's layout favors left-hand turns,
consistent with the track's 12-turn configuration. The extreme -312° reading
indicates drivers are making multiple steering corrections in slow corners.

🏎️  LONGITUDINAL ACCELERATION (accx_can):
-----------------------------------------
Mean: 0.002g (near-neutral)
Standard Deviation: 0.246g
Maximum Braking: -1.754g ⭐ PEAK DECELERATION
Maximum Acceleration: +0.825g

INSIGHT: Peak braking of 1.75g demonstrates aggressive threshold braking.
The relatively modest acceleration (0.825g) is typical for production-based
race cars with limited power modifications.

🌀 LATERAL ACCELERATION (accy_can):
----------------------------------
Mean: -0.049g (slight left cornering bias)
Standard Deviation: 0.582g
Maximum Left: -1.837g
Maximum Right: +2.047g ⭐ PEAK CORNERING FORCE

INSIGHT: Peak lateral G-force of 2.047g indicates high-grip racing slicks
and aggressive cornering. The higher right-side G-force (2.047g vs 1.837g)
suggests faster right-hand corners on the circuit.

⚙️  THROTTLE POSITION (ath):
---------------------------
Mean: 31.443% (moderate throttle usage)
Standard Deviation: 38.245%
Minimum: 2.050%
Maximum: 100.360% (full throttle + overrun)

INSIGHT: Mean throttle of 31% indicates Sonoma is a technical track with
limited full-throttle sections. Drivers spend significant time modulating
throttle through corners.

🔧 GEAR USAGE:
-------------
Mean Gear: 1.661 (between 1st and 2nd)
Standard Deviation: 1.173
Range: -1 (reverse) to 5 (5th gear)

INSIGHT: Low mean gear indicates tight, technical sections. The presence of
reverse gear usage suggests off-track excursions or grid positioning.

🏁 SPEED ANALYSIS:
-----------------
Mean Speed: 65.8 mph
Standard Deviation: 58.3 mph
Minimum: 0.0 mph (stopped)
Maximum: 189.8 mph ⭐ TOP SPEED

INSIGHT: Top speed of 189.8 mph likely achieved on the front straight.
The high standard deviation (58.3 mph) reflects Sonoma's varied corner
speeds from slow hairpins to fast sweepers.

🔴 ENGINE RPM (nmot):
--------------------
Mean RPM: 3,433 rpm
Standard Deviation: 2,809 rpm
Maximum: 7,387 rpm ⭐ REDLINE

INSIGHT: GR86 engines rev to approximately 7,400 rpm. Mean RPM of 3,433
suggests drivers spend time in lower rev ranges through technical sections.

🛑 BRAKE PRESSURE ANALYSIS:
--------------------------
Front Brake Pressure:
- Mean: 2.798 bar
- Standard Deviation: 14.113 bar
- Maximum: 166.135 bar ⭐ PEAK BRAKING

Rear Brake Pressure:
- Mean: 2.832 bar
- Standard Deviation: 14.206 bar
- Maximum: 167.965 bar

INSIGHT: Peak brake pressure exceeds 165 bar, indicating aggressive braking
zones. The similar front/rear pressures suggest balanced brake bias setup.

SECTION 4: COMPARATIVE RACE ANALYSIS
================================================================================

🔄 RACE 1 vs RACE 2 COMPARISON

⏱️  Lap Time Comparison:
-----------------------
Race 1 Mean: 384.887s (6:24.887) - SKEWED BY OUTLIERS
Race 2 Mean: 128.575s (2:08.575) - MORE REALISTIC
Difference: 256.313s (4:16.313)

Race 1 Median: 115.677s (1:55.677) ✅ ACCURATE
Race 2 Median: 116.711s (1:56.711) ✅ ACCURATE
Difference: 1.034s (minimal)

INSIGHT: Median lap times are nearly identical (1.034s difference), indicating
consistent performance across both races. The mean difference is artificial
due to outliers in Race 1 data.

🏎️  Participation:
-----------------
- Same 31 vehicles competed in both races
- 100% participation rate
- Race 1 had 359 more lap records (52% more)
- Suggests Race 1 was longer or had fewer retirements

📊 EXPECTED REALISTIC LAP TIMES:
-------------------------------
Based on median analysis and Sonoma's 2.52-mile layout:

Qualifying Pace: ~1:52-1:54 (fastest laps)
Race Pace: ~1:55-1:58 (consistent pace)
Traffic/Degraded: ~2:00-2:05 (late race)

These times align with professional GR Cup racing standards.

================================================================================
SECTION 5: CONSISTENCY & PERFORMANCE TRENDS
================================================================================

📊 CONSISTENCY ANALYSIS (Race 1)

Most Consistent Drivers (Lowest Standard Deviation):

1. GR86-033-046: σ=328.578s, Avg=3:56.762 ⭐ MOST CONSISTENT
2. GR86-016-055: σ=347.738s, Avg=3:38.083 ⭐ FAST + CONSISTENT
3. GR86-035-011: σ=439.655s, Avg=4:11.137

5. GR86-002-002: σ=489.884s, Avg=5:05.966

INSIGHT: GR86-016-055 demonstrates the ideal combination - fastest average
lap time (3:38) with excellent consistency (σ=347s). This driver is likely
the race winner or podium finisher.

📈 PERFORMANCE DEGRADATION ANALYSIS

Comparing First 10 Laps vs Last 10 Laps (Race 1):

All analyzed vehicles showed SLOWER performance in final laps:

1. GR86-002-002: ↗️ +456.051s slower (7.6 minutes)
2. GR86-003-017: ↗️ +799.014s slower (13.3 minutes)
3. GR86-004-078: ↗️ +1,281.256s slower (21.4 minutes)
4. GR86-006-007: ↗️ +1,148.864s slower (19.1 minutes)
5. GR86-008-113: ↗️ +1,676.736s slower (27.9 minutes)

⚠️  ANALYSIS NOTE: These extreme degradation values are likely influenced by
the data quality issues (zero values, outliers). A more accurate analysis
would require filtered data excluding anomalies.

EXPECTED DEGRADATION (Typical GR Cup Race):
- Tire degradation: 1-2 seconds per lap over 20-lap stint
- Fuel load reduction: Improves lap times by 0.5-1.0s
- Driver fatigue: Minimal in 45-minute races

🏁 TRACK-SPECIFIC INSIGHTS (Sonoma Raceway)

Turn Characteristics (Inferred from Telemetry):
------------------------------------------------

SLOW CORNERS (Steering Angle > 200°):
- Hairpin turns requiring 1st/2nd gear
- Heavy braking zones (>150 bar)
- Exit traction critical

MEDIUM CORNERS (Steering Angle 100-200°):
- 3rd/4th gear corners
- Moderate braking (80-120 bar)
- Balanced throttle application

FAST CORNERS (Steering Angle < 100°):
- 4th/5th gear sweepers
- Light braking or lift-off
- Peak lateral G-forces (>1.8g)

📊 OPTIMAL RACING LINE INDICATORS:

The telemetry suggests optimal performance requires:
- Peak braking of 1.5-1.75g (threshold braking)
- Lateral G-forces of 1.8-2.0g (maximum grip)
- Throttle application >80% on straights
- Smooth steering inputs (avoid >250° corrections)

================================================================================

   Impact: May miss rare events or patterns
   Recommendation: Implement distributed processing for full dataset

================================================================================
SECTION 8: STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

🏁 FOR RACE ENGINEERS:

1. TIRE STRATEGY:
   - Monitor lateral G-forces (>2.0g indicates aggressive driving)
   - Plan pit stops when lap times degrade >2 seconds
